## Description

We used React.js to accomplish the MERN stack. We used express and node to get the server up and running. We also used Mongoose to serve as our database. We also used page components to render the pages. We used front end Java and CSS to help with the display. We used apollo and graphQl to serve the user's desires that our server has to offer.

## Motivation

We wanted people to have a better way of managing their time and their task to fulfill all of their work and personal errands but also have time for theirselves and family.

## Usage

Upon page load the user is automatically redirected to the login page wherein they are required to sign up if not logged in yet in order to use the app. The user upon login is then given access to add delete or update the tasks of their own choice.
